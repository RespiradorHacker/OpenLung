# Contributing
## Welcome!
Welcome to the Open Source Ventilator Project.  We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.

This project can use your help! We need help designing mechanical parts, electronics, firmware and user experience.

We also strongly value documentation and gladly accept improvements to the documentation.
