# Contributing
## Welcome!
Welcome to the Open Source Ventilator Project.  We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.
This project can use your help! We need help designing mechanical parts, electronics, firmware and user experience.
We also strongly value documentation and gladly accept improvements to the documentation.
If you have questions regarding documentation or would like to know specifics on how you can contribute, please visit the issues tracker on the left in GitLab.

# How To Join in Development:
1. Fill out our Expression of Interest Form [here](https://opensourceventilator.ie/register) if you haven't already.
*This step is mandatory and itâ€™s how we will find you to match your skills to areas you can help. If you have fabrication equipment, also fill out this form.*
2. We will reach out when your noted skills are needed, until then please check out the following:
-- Stay up to date with the project on our website [Open Source Ventilators Ireland](https://opensourceventilator.ie/) and our social channels.
-- Join our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/osventilator/shared_invite/zt-cst4dhk7-BFNMz_vyBPthjlBFYV1yWA) to join the conversation. Many other side projects are happening there.
3. Get familiar with git by learning how to best contribute to this repository. There are many resources available online, you can start [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enMumwvLAug) or learn how to submit a merge request [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html).
4. If you are anxious and would like to get developing, this is open source, please fork this repo and go for it!

## How to Contribute:

Check out the [README](README.md) for details on how to get involved. Take a look around and see what you think we're missing. Look in the issues and comment or do what you can  to help. This is a global effort and we'll take all of the help that we can get. That said, we do have some guidelines.

If you're a native speaker or translator of a language that you see listed on our ReadMe or you think needs to have a translation, please feel free to submit an issue request and let us know you can do that.

## How To Submit Changes to the Repo:

We use the fork/merge process, rather than maintaining multiple protected branches. If you're not sure what that means, it's okay, feel free to reach out to us via [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osventilator/shared_invite/zt-cst4dhk7-BFNMz_vyBPthjlBFYV1yWA).

### Quick Process:

   - Fork the repo to your own GitLab account.
   - Clone your repo to your local device, making changes there.
   - Push any changes you make to your forked repo on GitLab.
   - Request a merge with the main repo and it will be reviewed by a member of the team.
