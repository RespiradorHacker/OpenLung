the mask can be replaced with a neck trake tube, superglautic device. (Known)
an LMA, differet type of tube = No loss of air in the tubing is important. Some loss happens when using the trakial and face mask.
Lungs work on negative pressure, machine on positive. When you are breathing yourself on the LMA. 
Optimal approach for low infrastructure would be LMA, betrer ETT (Closed loop system). Autonomic resistance is a problem. 
In ards, patients are easy to ventilate with low pressure and have good autonomic compliance, 
Air systems - 13700 KPascal pressure in Big ass cylinder outside that is stored in liquid form @(-117) stored in cylinder manifold, store in a vaccum insulated evaportor VIE (stored at -165) (Warming oxygen). 
Stainless on the inside, perlite insulated. Pure steel on the outside. 17 bar relase pressure, piped out at 4 bar.
Oxygen requirment determination is hard. Ideal world (End tidal CO2, Neuro protective, can change PH balance, as ph changes, it must change the way it discharge waste), (Breathing too frequently will wast C02 and cause faintness), SP02 finger probe, nose, finger, ear, toe (small vascular pool) externally.
Stickyness (Dycem) for temporary adhesive (Design idea). An over ambundance of negative pressure and flow will may degrade a valve. If the patient has a heartbeat or inhaling, then normally 12 breaths per minute during emergency intake. 
TO adjust the end title ETC02, increase, reduce volume or vent rate. TO Decrease ECT02, increase volume, or vent rate.
@lego_doc. Simple chirp alarm. Its easier to get approval for an accessory to a pre approved device. Student nurse level of knowledge. (Ratio tracking).
