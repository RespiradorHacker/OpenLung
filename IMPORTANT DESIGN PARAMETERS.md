# Important Design Parameters
### Patient Interfaces Supported:
 - Mask
 - Tracheostomy
 - LMA (Supraglottic Airway Device) Link Here for those curious

### LMA Notes:
- LMA minimizes loss of air pressure.
- LMA and Trach are more invasive and increase the risk of lung infections long-term over the mask.
- Some pressure loss happens when using the tracheal and face mask.
- Lungs work on negative pressure, machine on positive.
- An over-abundance of negative pressure and flow will degrade a valve.
- When you are breathing yourself on the LMA. The optimal approach for low infrastructure would be LMA, better ETT (Closed-loop system).
- Autonomic resistance with LMA is a problem. Will hospitals continue to have meds to keep patients under sedation while recovering?
- In ARDS, patients are easy to ventilate with low pressure and have good autonomic compliance.

### Air systems:

- 13700 KPascal pressure in large cylinder outside that is stored in liquid form @(-117) stored in cylinder manifold, store in a vacuum insulated evaporator VIE (stored at -165) (Warming oxygen).
- Stainless on the inside, perlite insulated.
- Pure steel on the outside.
- 17 bar release pressure, piped out at 4 bar.

### O2 Regulation:

- Oxygen requirement determination is hard.
- SP02 finger probe, nose, finger, ear, toe (small vascular pool) externally. Stickiness (Dycem) for temporary adhesive (Design idea).

### ETCO2:

- End-tidal CO2, Neuroprotective, can change PH balance, as ph changes, it must change the way it discharges waste), (Breathing too frequently will wast C02 and cause faintness)
- To adjust the end-tidal ETC02, increase, reduce volume or vent rate. TO Decrease ETC02, increase volume, or vent rate.

### Misc:

- If the patient has a heartbeat or inhaling, then normally 12 breaths per minute during emergency intake.
- Simple chirp alarm. Its easier to get approval for an accessory to a pre-approved device.
