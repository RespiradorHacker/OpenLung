PEEP - Positive End Expiratory Pressure

Fso2 - From O2 tank or wall fixture - Supplimental oxygen
Fdo2 - Fraction of Delivered oxygen - How much got to the patient

3 Valves at the back end

1. One way check valve (Disk type) Ensuring the one way flow of breathing support gasses
2. One way check valve (Disk type) allowing Room air to enter in the event of heavy negative pressure
3. One way check valve (Disk type) preventing too much flow into the patient or too much positive pressure
