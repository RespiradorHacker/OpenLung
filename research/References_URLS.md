- Google Patents
A device for automatically squeezing and releasing an AMBU-bag is disclosed. A device has a housing, and a mechanical compression squeezer in the housing. There are openings in the housing for inlet tubes and outlet tubes of AMBU-bag to pass in and out of the housing. A powered actuator powers the compression squeezer.

In this paper the project titled an automated breathing device for critically ill patients has been discussed. Ambu bag (AB) is a flexible reservoir bag used for artificial ventilation connected by tubing and non-rebreathing valve to a face mask or endo-tracheal tube. It is a hand held device used to provide positive pressure ventilation to a patient who is not breathing or who is breathing inadequately [1]. In ambulances and in emergency wards of hospitals manually operated ambu bag is used. Bagging is necessarily regular in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient or has ceased completely and also to provide mechanical ventilation in preference to mouth to mouth resuscitation. The problems involved in this type of manual ambu bag is that sometimes due to the negligence of the caretakers required quantity of oxygen is not carried over to the lungs, secondly even if the caretakers are alert one cannot assure that they expel a constant quantity of oxygen into the patient's lungs, thirdly this type of mechanism basically is a stress to the caretakers. To overcome this, an automatic mechanism for administering oxygen into the patient's body has been developed and tested successfully. This automated ambu bag is economically cheap and gives much comfort to the care takers and the required amount of oxygen can be delivered appropriately according to the need of the patient.

The addition of the elastic strap to the face-mask allows the device to operate hands-free. The hand crank system acts as a replacement for the motorized battery powered version of the device

- Umbulizer patent

Abstract A method of ventilating a patient controls an actuator, in accordance with a prescribed value for a respiratory parameter, to compress an inflatable bag to cause air to flow out of an output valve of the bag. The respiratory parameter s may include tidal volume, pressure, volume limit, peak pressure, I:E ratio, inspiratory time, and/or breathing rate of the air flowing through the output valve. The method also senses the pressure flowing through the output valve, and sends a pressure signal to the controller. Additionally, the method senses the flow rate through the output valve, and sends a flow rate signal to the controller. The method also adjusts the compression of the actuator as a function of the flow rate signal and/or the pressure signal to adjust the output tidal volume, pressure, volume limit, peak pressure, I:E ratio, inspiratory time, and/or breathing rate to be in accordance with the prescribed value.

Comments from @ekamioka
I don't want to hold this wonderful project up whatsoever and I would like to contribute on the electronics side if I can. However, I want to ask if anyone has looked at the Umbulizer patent, whether there's any overlap that could be easily avoided without detriment to the final function of openlung and would make sure that the success of openlung isn't reduced by adverse legal issues or sentiment.
